NAME
   dna-solver | C++ implementation

SYNOPSIS
   solver [OPTIONS]...

DESCRIPTION:
   This program implements a C++ library for Genetic Algorithm optimization. To solve optimization problems, make a new directory and define the model for the Genes, Chromosomes and Fitness function, then configure the parameters and run the algorithm in the main.cpp file.

   * To run the GA method, it only requires the fitness function to be passed to its constructor. So chromosomes are built from the fitness model.
   * Genes can be adapted to any type of variable or class, and only requires a constructor and a randomize function for their initialization.
   * Chromosomes are arrays of Genes, and the crossover and mutation operators cannot be modified (yet), as the base class implements these methods.
   * The fitness function is responsible of creating new Chromosomes and evaluating them.
