        <p>This is a NodeJS and ReactJS based web application that allows its users to test 
        genetic algorithms optimizers with many different configurations to compare their 
        performance in solving the most common problems present in the combinatorial 
        optimization literature.</p>
        <p>This project was developed under the context of the final work for the posgraduate 
        course <i>"Advanced Techniques for Evolutionary Computation"</i> by
